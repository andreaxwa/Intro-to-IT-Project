  Topic: 
    
<p>Our project will focus on developing a “hybrid” carbon footprint tracking app that is called RMITGreen and specifically designed for RMIT students. This app is expected to serve as an accessible, convenient, and engaging tool that can help RMIT students leave a positive impact on the community they’re studying and living in.</p>
    
<p>By offering a comprehensive set of functionalities, we expect our app can help RMIT students increase their level of environmental awareness and interest and empower them to make a difference in the fight against rising emissions in Vietnam. First of all, by including calculator and tracker systems into our app, we hope to assist RMIT students in measuring and monitoring their emissions, thereby becoming more aware of their environmental impacts. We will also provide users with relevant news and resources that can help them gain a better understanding of eco practices and stay updated on current environmental problems. In addition, we will offer features that enable users to set goals, engage in interesting challenges, and communicate their progress with their peers, so as to make them feel motivated and inspired to make behavioral changes. Lastly, we will continuously monitor and make improvements to our app to make it a practical and reliable tool that will be integrated seamlessly into every RMIT student’s daily life to help them make informed decisions when it comes to lifestyle choices.</p>
    
<p>In the end, we hope this project will serve as a demonstration of our abilities to leverage technologies to drive positive changes and contribute significantly to the development of a more sustainable future for RMIT.</p>
    
  Motivation: 
    
    Several factors motivated us to develop this project. First of all, it’s reported that emissions in Vietnam have increased by a staggering 515% and that per person rose by 362% over the past two decades, which highlights the urgent need for individuals to take meaningful steps to reduce their environmental impacts across all aspects of their lives (countryeconomy n.d.; statista n.d.). However, in fact, the majority of Vietnamese young adults, including students in higher education, who are considered to have the potential to drive change, still lack environmental knowledge and show little interest in sustainable living (UNDP 2022). This is because the majority of them lack access to convenient and interactive tools that can help improve their environmental literacy, manage their footprints, and empower them to adopt sustainable lifestyle choices. By developing this app, we hope to provide RMIT students with a more accessible tool that can assist them in doing so. In addition, while universities, as organizations engaged in education, generate a substantial amount of GHG emissions and should play a pioneering role in taking initiatives to reduce their carbon output, most of them have still made limited efforts to do so (Valls-Val and Bovea 2022; Thang 2020). Therefore, as RMIT students, we realized the need to join hands with our university to help it become a sustainability leader within the community it’s operating in. Given that RMIT has already done a fantastic job of offering various education programs to increase students’ environmental conscience, we feel compelled to create a similar alternative, but in a more accessible, convenient, and interesting format.
    
    The idea behind this project follows the IT trend of utilizing technology to address environmental issues; in our case, we’re developing an application that assist students in raising environmental consciousness within the RMIT community (appssemble n.d.). Our app will be developed as a progressive web app (PWA)- a technology that can provide a native app–like user experience across different mobile devices (Dqindia 2022). By doing so, we can ensure RMIT students, the vast majority of whom use iOS- or Android-powered smartphones or laptops, can easily access and interact with our app. Furthermore, with the incorporation of game and social elements (e.g., badges, leaderboards, challenges) and data visualization components (e.g., graphs, charts) into our app, we can create a more attractive and user-engaged platform that can not only motivate students to make behavioral changes, but can also better understand their emissions data (Deloitte n.d.). This strategy can not only increase users’ stickiness to our app but also align with the app gamification and visualizing trend nowadays (Wetzler 2021).
    
    If we were able to work on this project, we would be able to showcase to potential employers  a combination of skills that are critical for IT-related jobs. To be more specific, we can demonstrate our strong technical skills in web development by being proficient in front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java) and back-end development (server-side programming languages, database management). Furthermore, when we successfully finish the project, we can demonstrate our project management abilities (e.g., planning, task allocation, time management, collaboration, problem-solving, adaptability, and communication) to our future employers (Martins 2023). Most importantly, by coming up with an IT solution to address an existing environmental problem, we can show them that not only are we well-aware of current issues happening around us, but we can also figure out an innovative way to tackle these issues. 
    
  Landscape:
    
    In Vietnam, the government’s goal of reaching “carbon emission neutrality” by the year 2050 has prompted organizations and citizens alike to take proactive steps to cut their carbon output (Reuters 2021). These potential audiences are the driving force behind the proliferation of different kinds of environmental apps, which can be considered our app’s direct and indirect competitors. Direct competitors might include popular eco-friendly apps on the market, such as Greenly, Footprint, WWF’s My Footprint, or MyClimate, all of which, despite offering a wider range of features, still have some functions similar to ours and cater to a broader audience (WWF n.d.; Greenly n.d.; Footprint n.d.; MyClimate n.d.). Additionally, similar apps from nationwide universities, such as FPT or Vietnam National University, can become our app’s potential direct competitors if their products’ scope extends and they are able to reach more customers (VNU 2023; Wang 2015). With respect to indirect competitors, other technologies with built-in health tracking features (e.g., steps, heartbeat, sugar level) and online websites or platforms dedicated to providing sustainability-focused resources (e.g., EcoWatch, Earth911, or Sustainably Chic) might be considered indirect ones. This is because, while they don’t provide the exact functions as our app, they do provide alternatives that can indirectly assist users in getting a better grasp of environmental issues and managing their footprints (Bolt n.d.). 
    
    We believe our app’s target customer base, PWA technology, gamification and social elements, and data visualization components will make it stand out from the competition. Unlike other popular apps that are aimed at the general public, our app is catered to the needs of RMIT students, enabling them to calculate and 
track their emissions across the most relevant categories for an average student. Also, for the convenience of our students, we develop our app as a PWA to make it more accessible on both iOS and Android- powered devices. Lastly, by understanding our students’ need for an interactive, captivating, and convenient tool that can help them manage and communicate their footprints, we have collaborative and data visualization components (e.g., challenges, shared progress, rewards, bars, and charts) incorporated into our app to increase our users’ experience and keep them motivated and inspired to strive toward their sustainability goal. 
    
Detailed Description:
    
    We aim to develop a user-friendly, interactive, and reliable web app that allows RMIT students to comprehend, quantify, and communicate their environmental impacts, leading to increased environmental awareness and behavioral modifications. To accomplish the foregoing, we set up a couple of smaller and more manageable goals to help us identify ‘should-be-prioritized’ tasks, track our progress, and allow for a gradual approach to success.
    
    First, we will focus on improving the precision and reliability of the calculation function, and this goal is the one that we’ll give the most priority to. Since estimating users’ carbon footprints is our app’s core functionality, if we fail to provide users with accurate emissions estimates, they won’t be able to truly understand their environmental impacts. This will compromise our app's primary goal of helping students measure their footprints and might potentially result in reduced credibility and a loss of users’ trust and engagement. Therefore, we believe more solutions should be taken in the future to improve our app’s processes of data collection and algorithm design to increase the dependability of our app (e.g., making changes in the content and presentation of inquiries while ensuring the friendliness of the app, or developing advanced formulas or calculation methods before integrating them into the API server).

    Second, after providing accurate estimations, the offering of personalized recommendations and useful insights should be taken into account. This aspect is important as it acts as a guideline for more accurate, appropriate, and effective actions users can take to reduce or offset their footprints based on their input data or recorded progress. By concentrating on developing this feature, we can not only ensure the trustworthiness of our app but also help our students become more environmentally conscious and educated.

    Third, we’ll pay attention to the integration of gamification and social elements into our app. This goal can be considered a secondary one in comparison with the previous two since it will only become meaningful when the foundation functions are perfected. By adding these elements, users can share or compare their progress with their friends, engage in friendly competitions or challenges, and receive rewards when completing their goals. This will create a friendly-competitive yet supportive environment in which users will feel motivated to continue using our app to make behavioral changes, thereby increasing their engagement. 

    Last but not least, we aim to focus on developing our app as a PWA to enhance its accessibility characteristics. By doing so, all RMIT students, irrespective of the operating systems their devices are running on or any locations they’re in, can access our app as both a web app and a mobile app. Although Tandel and Jamadar (2018) stated that this approach can come at the cost of offline access (data won’t be updated and synchronized until users are online again, and first-time users must have the internet to install before being able to use it offline), and a confusing user experience, we realize that its benefits (e.g., progressive, responsive, engageable, and connectivity independent) have far outweighed its drawbacks. We’ll consider implementing techniques to take advantage of this approach and mitigate its shortcomings.
