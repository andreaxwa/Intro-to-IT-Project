    <h4>Trang</h4>

    <p>My name is Trang Nguyen (s3892190). I was born and raised in Can Tho, but now I reside in HCMC. Before joining RMIT, I spent 2 years studying at a public university with a focus on International Relations, and currently, I’m a Logistics major at RMIT. In my free time, I enjoy reading, especially books about history, health, international affairs, and business. I’m also into exercising, traveling, and hanging out with friends. When it comes to IT, I am interested in learning about new hot topics in technology so that I can keep up with the latest developments and trends in the area, and hopefully, I can become more knowledgeable in the field that I don't expose myself to quite often on a regular basis. Also, I have been starting to get familiar with IT tools, such as Excel, PowerBI, or MySQL. Since these tools have been widely utilized in my field of work, being able to use them effectively will allow me to make informed decisions and improve my productivity and performance in both my personal and professional lives. Regarding my IT experience, I used to have experience working with ERP- a supply chain software platform serving as a solution for businesses to streamline their processes. I learned how to use RFID scanners to collect data, understand different types of logistics data, analyze the data, and extract insights from it. I have worked with designing software, such as Canva, to help design posters and presentation slides/videos for my group and individual assignments, which I believe is a useful way to help me improve my editing and designing skills.

    <h4>Duong</h4>

    <p>My name is Hoang Vo Thuy Duong, but I also go by Andrea. My student ID is s3927106. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). I received most of my education at the Asian International School, Thai Van Lung campus in District 1. During the last two years of high school, I studied in the US, but then I returned to Vietnam to be closer to my family and enrolled at RMIT University Vietnam. Reading is one of my favorite hobbies, I particularly like the fantasy and science fiction genres. I can communicate in four foreign languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Mandarin) with various degrees of fluency and have a strong desire to learn more. Currently, I'm focusing on learning German. Since I was a child, I've been familiar with the IT field because of my father, who taught himself and found a job in IT after graduating, despite having a degree in International Payments. While studying in the US, I joined the Robotics team in my town and developed a bond with a teammate who taught me the basics of coding. A special person in my life encouraged me to learn Python, which has become my favorite programming language. Since the beginning of this year, I have completed several Python projects through Jetbrains Academy. I have a general interest in IT, but I'm particularly drawn to Cybersecurity because of my special person. Through the Intro to IT course, I have gained knowledge in HTML & CSS as well as using Github.</p>

    <h2 style="color: green">Project Description</h2>

    <h3 style="color: green">A. Overview</h3>
    
  <h3 style="color: green">Topic</h3>
    
<p>Our project will focus on developing a “hybrid” carbon footprint tracking app that is called RMITGreen and specifically designed for RMIT students. This app is expected to serve as an accessible, convenient, and engaging tool that can help RMIT students leave a positive impact on the community they’re studying and living in.</p>
    
<p>By offering a comprehensive set of functionalities, we expect our app can help RMIT students increase their level of environmental awareness and interest and empower them to make a difference in the fight against rising emissions in Vietnam. First of all, by including calculator and tracker systems into our app, we hope to assist RMIT students in measuring and monitoring their emissions, thereby becoming more aware of their environmental impacts. We will also provide users with relevant news and resources that can help them gain a better understanding of eco practices and stay updated on current environmental problems. In addition, we will offer features that enable users to set goals, engage in interesting challenges, and communicate their progress with their peers, so as to make them feel motivated and inspired to make behavioral changes. Lastly, we will continuously monitor and make improvements to our app to make it a practical and reliable tool that will be integrated seamlessly into every RMIT student’s daily life to help them make informed decisions when it comes to lifestyle choices.</p>
    
<p>In the end, we hope this project will serve as a demonstration of our abilities to leverage technologies to drive positive changes and contribute significantly to the development of a more sustainable future for RMIT.</p>
    
  <h3 style="color: green">Motivation</h3>
    
<p>Several factors motivated us to develop this project. First of all, it’s reported that emissions in Vietnam have increased by a staggering 515% and that per person rose by 362% over the past two decades, which highlights the urgent need for individuals to take meaningful steps to reduce their environmental impacts across all aspects of their lives (countryeconomy n.d.; statista n.d.). However, in fact, the majority of Vietnamese young adults, including students in higher education, who are considered to have the potential to drive change, still lack environmental knowledge and show little interest in sustainable living (UNDP 2022). This is because the majority of them lack access to convenient and interactive tools that can help improve their environmental literacy, manage their footprints, and empower them to adopt sustainable lifestyle choices. By developing this app, we hope to provide RMIT students with a more accessible tool that can assist them in doing so. In addition, while universities, as organizations engaged in education, generate a substantial amount of GHG emissions and should play a pioneering role in taking initiatives to reduce their carbon output, most of them have still made limited efforts to do so (Valls-Val and Bovea 2022; Thang 2020). Therefore, as RMIT students, we realized the need to join hands with our university to help it become a sustainability leader within the community it’s operating in. Given that RMIT has already done a fantastic job of offering various education programs to increase students’ environmental conscience, we feel compelled to create a similar alternative, but in a more accessible, convenient, and interesting format.
    
<p>The idea behind this project follows the IT trend of utilizing technology to address environmental issues; in our case, we’re developing an application that assist students in raising environmental consciousness within the RMIT community (appssemble n.d.). Our app will be developed as a progressive web app (PWA)- a technology that can provide a native app–like user experience across different mobile devices (Dqindia 2022). By doing so, we can ensure RMIT students, the vast majority of whom use iOS- or Android-powered smartphones or laptops, can easily access and interact with our app. Furthermore, with the incorporation of game and social elements (e.g., badges, leaderboards, challenges) and data visualization components (e.g., graphs, charts) into our app, we can create a more attractive and user-engaged platform that can not only motivate students to make behavioral changes, but can also better understand their emissions data (Deloitte n.d.). This strategy can not only increase users’ stickiness to our app but also align with the app gamification and visualizing trend nowadays (Wetzler 2021).
    
<p>If we were able to work on this project, we would be able to showcase to potential employers  a combination of skills that are critical for IT-related jobs. To be more specific, we can demonstrate our strong technical skills in web development by being proficient in front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java) and back-end development (server-side programming languages, database management). Furthermore, when we successfully finish the project, we can demonstrate our project management abilities (e.g., planning, task allocation, time management, collaboration, problem-solving, adaptability, and communication) to our future employers (Martins 2023). Most importantly, by coming up with an IT solution to address an existing environmental problem, we can show them that not only are we well-aware of current issues happening around us, but we can also figure out an innovative way to tackle these issues. 
    
  <h3 style="color: green">Landscape</h3>
    
<p>In Vietnam, the government’s goal of reaching “carbon emission neutrality” by the year 2050 has prompted organizations and citizens alike to take proactive steps to cut their carbon output (Reuters 2021). These potential audiences are the driving force behind the proliferation of different kinds of environmental apps, which can be considered our app’s direct and indirect competitors. Direct competitors might include popular eco-friendly apps on the market, such as Greenly, Footprint, WWF’s My Footprint, or MyClimate, all of which, despite offering a wider range of features, still have some functions similar to ours and cater to a broader audience (WWF n.d.; Greenly n.d.; Footprint n.d.; MyClimate n.d.). Additionally, similar apps from nationwide universities, such as FPT or Vietnam National University, can become our app’s potential direct competitors if their products’ scope extends and they are able to reach more customers (VNU 2023; Wang 2015). With respect to indirect competitors, other technologies with built-in health tracking features (e.g., steps, heartbeat, sugar level) and online websites or platforms dedicated to providing sustainability-focused resources (e.g., EcoWatch, Earth911, or Sustainably Chic) might be considered indirect ones. This is because, while they don’t provide the exact functions as our app, they do provide alternatives that can indirectly assist users in getting a better grasp of environmental issues and managing their footprints (Bolt n.d.). 
    
<p>We believe our app’s target customer base, PWA technology, gamification and social elements, and data visualization components will make it stand out from the competition. Unlike other popular apps that are aimed at the general public, our app is catered to the needs of RMIT students, enabling them to calculate and 
track their emissions across the most relevant categories for an average student. Also, for the convenience of our students, we develop our app as a PWA to make it more accessible on both iOS and Android- powered devices. Lastly, by understanding our students’ need for an interactive, captivating, and convenient tool that can help them manage and communicate their footprints, we have collaborative and data visualization components (e.g., challenges, shared progress, rewards, bars, and charts) incorporated into our app to increase our users’ experience and keep them motivated and inspired to strive toward their sustainability goal. 
    
  <h3 style="color: green">B. Detailed Description</h3>
    
  <h3 style="color: green">Aims</h3>

    <p>We aim to develop a user-friendly, interactive, and reliable web app that allows RMIT students to comprehend, quantify, and communicate their environmental impacts, leading to increased environmental awareness and behavioral modifications. To accomplish the foregoing, we set up a couple of smaller and more manageable goals to help us identify ‘should-be-prioritized’ tasks, track our progress, and allow for a gradual approach to success.
    
    <p>First, we will focus on improving the precision and reliability of the calculation function, and this goal is the one that we’ll give the most priority to. Since estimating users’ carbon footprints is our app’s core functionality, if we fail to provide users with accurate emissions estimates, they won’t be able to truly understand their environmental impacts. This will compromise our app's primary goal of helping students measure their footprints and might potentially result in reduced credibility and a loss of users’ trust and engagement. Therefore, we believe more solutions should be taken in the future to improve our app’s processes of data collection and algorithm design to increase the dependability of our app (e.g., making changes in the content and presentation of inquiries while ensuring the friendliness of the app, or developing advanced formulas or calculation methods before integrating them into the API server).

    <p>Second, after providing accurate estimations, the offering of personalized recommendations and useful insights should be taken into account. This aspect is important as it acts as a guideline for more accurate, appropriate, and effective actions users can take to reduce or offset their footprints based on their input data or recorded progress. By concentrating on developing this feature, we can not only ensure the trustworthiness of our app but also help our students become more environmentally conscious and educated.

    <p>Third, we’ll pay attention to the integration of gamification and social elements into our app. This goal can be considered a secondary one in comparison with the previous two since it will only become meaningful when the foundation functions are perfected. By adding these elements, users can share or compare their progress with their friends, engage in friendly competitions or challenges, and receive rewards when completing their goals. This will create a friendly-competitive yet supportive environment in which users will feel motivated to continue using our app to make behavioral changes, thereby increasing their engagement. 

    <p>Last but not least, we aim to focus on developing our app as a PWA to enhance its accessibility characteristics. By doing so, all RMIT students, irrespective of the operating systems their devices are running on or any locations they’re in, can access our app as both a web app and a mobile app. Although Tandel and Jamadar (2018) stated that this approach can come at the cost of offline access (data won’t be updated and synchronized until users are online again, and first-time users must have the internet to install before being able to use it offline), and a confusing user experience, we realize that its benefits (e.g., progressive, responsive, engageable, and connectivity independent) have far outweighed its drawbacks. We’ll consider implementing techniques to take advantage of this approach and mitigate its shortcomings.

    <h2 style="color: green">Group Reflection</h2>
        <p>As a whole, our group has performed very well in navigating this group project through different phases. Over the past 12 weeks, we’ve learned valuable lessons about our group’s strengths and weaknesses and had chances to expose ourselves to eye-opening experiences. </p>
        <p>The most notable characteristics of our group is probably the supportive environment that we established. Understanding that members of our group come from different backgrounds and each of them might have different problems, we’ve tried our best to offer assistance to him or her whenever possible. For example, if anyone struggles with their assignments or just simply has a life problem and wants to share it, we’ll always be ready (both online and offline) to support each other. In fact, we usually spend time engaging in physical meetings or online discussions to discuss our assignments or random topics that we’re interested in, or help our friends to better understand a new IT concept. Since there’s an ELS member within our group, we always ensure to assign tasks that are well-suited to him and offer support whenever possible to help him contribute his best work. Another strength of our group is that we always respect and listen to everyone’s ideas and opinions. When someone in the group has opposing opinions, they all try to explain clearly and patiently in a constructive and respectful way so that the other side can understand the problem, and then come to a unified conclusion. However, our group still has areas for improvements. All members agreed that we have encountered certain issues with time management and collaboration. Due to some members’ busy schedules, our group experienced a deadline rush several times. The surprising thing was that we all tried to adapt and make the necessary adjustments to share responsibilities with others, so that we could be able to overcome this challenge. Regarding the collaboration problem, we sometimes are not able to understand our special member's studying methods, thereby not being able to create opportunities for him to make full contributions. However, having a chance to work with him is our pleasure as we are actually inspired a lot by his will and resilience.</p>
        <p>Overall, through this project, all of us had a chance to reflect on our progress and gained useful insights about successful teamwork. Our group project’s results are driven by effective communication, diversity, understanding, and adaptability, given the fact that we still deal with time management and collaboration issues. We believe the experiences we have gained during the 12-week period doing this project will be beneficial for our future group efforts.  </p>
    <h2 style="color: green">Appendices</h2>
    <p> Appendix 1. Reflections of each member </p>
        <p><b>Trung:</b> The last twelve weeks have been such a meaningful experience, as I’ve had the chance to work with fantastic people. We have worked very well, not just as a team but also as a family. Team members always tried their best to deliver their work on time with the highest quality, and we also maintained communication to lend a helping hand when anyone had difficulty. It was great that everyone was open to talking, as it gave us the chance to get to know each other better; hence, the team could work better together. Because of that, it was rare to see conflict within the team. However, the time management of the team is not very good, as we were often in a rush for a couple of days before the deadline due to the heavy workload coming from many distinct courses of members. Then, everybody amazed me at how friendly and sympathetic they were, because we all had the chance to share our expressions, difficulties, which could also be outside of the lesson, and then gain advice from other members. Lastly, being a part of the team has taught me to be more open-minded and companionable, and I really appreciate being a member of this family.</p> 
        <p><b>Trang:</b> Overall, I think our group has been doing a fantastic job so far. Everyone has tried their best to make valuable contributions to the group’s project and has gradually become more comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings with each other. Since the first time we formed our group, open communication has been maintained regularly. We actually organized many online and offline discussions or meetings to either create bonding opportunities for everyone or discuss our assignments (e.g., setting deadlines, allocating tasks, asking questions, talking about any topics that we’re interested in). However, sometimes we encounter problems with time management and maintaining regular contact due to the hectic schedules of other members. As our group has one ELS member, working with him is not easy, as Hoang is not always ready to open up; however, this experience turned out to be really eye-opening for me. I actually learned a lot from my friend’s consistency and determination. Despite having health problems, Hoang made an effort to overcome everything and completed all the tasks that our group assigned to him. He’s also a truly great listener. In short, I think everyone in our group has actually successfully created a supportive, motivated environment in which I always feel fulfilled and inspired to contribute more to the group’s outcome. </p>
        <p><b>Duong:</b> Overall, I believe the teamwork was really great. It seems that everyone in our group is a unique factor that contributes to our collective success. Hoang, a special member of our group, has performed very well in making an effort to contribute to the group work despite his difficulties in writing and seeing. I think he’s a great person and an inspiration for our group, and I actually learned a lot from him. Cuong and Trung, who are the only two members of our group pursuing IT-related majors, are very dedicated to the group work and they seem to know what they are going to do to advance in their future careers. So does Trang- a Logistics major who, together with me when we first met each other in this course, asked for other members to join our group. Although our group had a certain level of difficulty when working with Hoang, I think we did a great job in setting smaller goals (e.g. deadlines for each part, detailed task allocations, timely updates) and successfully completing them, allowing us to manage to complete the whole assignment more efficiently. I hope our group will have more bonding opportunities and can still keep in touch after this course.</p>
        <p><b>Hoang:</b> As a special member of our group, I know I haven’t always been the easiest person to work with. However, I want to thank everyone for their patience and understanding.  Despite some inconvenience I’ve caused, they've tried their best to stick with me and support me as much as possible, making me feel acknowledged and respected. We actually had many interesting discussions after class, but I wish we would have had more opportunities to hang out and get to know each other better. I feel grateful for the group’s willingness to let me join in and their consistent support to keep me updated on the assignment’s details, the class’s announcements, or the meetings' schedule. I hope everyone will pass this course with flying colors and succeed in their future careers. I hope we will have opportunities to work together in other courses as well. Thank you so much!</p>
        <p><b>Cuong:</b> Being a member of the “Fivetastic” group has been a wonderful and rewarding experience. I’ve had the chance to work with a diverse and talented group whose members come from different majors, such as logistics, HR, or software engineering. Each person brings their own unique set of skills and knowledge to contribute to the group work, and everyone is really professional and dedicated to every task they’re assigned. The group’s friendliness and accommodations have helped me easily settle into the new environment, as this is my first semester at RMIT after spending 3 years studying in Canada. There were times when we were overwhelmed with the workload or had conflicting ideas while doing assignments. However, by maintaining open communication in a respectful and constructive manner and a sense of shared responsibility, we were able to overcome these challenges. I’m surprised at our group’s results, as they exceeded my expectations, and each of us has made progress after each assignment. I’ve learned so much from the group’s methods of choosing teammates, allocating tasks, setting deadlines, and handling unwanted conflicts. I’m sure I’m going to apply these tips to my group assignments in the future. </p>
